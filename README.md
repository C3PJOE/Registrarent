Registraren't is a game where you play as a registrar at a very reputable university. 

Following some horrible failure of the school's automated registrar system, which normally sorts through and approves students' schedules for the next semester, 
it is up to you to manually inspect each student's prospective schedule and determine whether it should be approved or rejected. Are you up to the task?
